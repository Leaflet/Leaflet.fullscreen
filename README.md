## Leaflet.fullscreen
A HTML5 fullscreen plugin for Leaflet.

## Install

To install the plugin run `npm install leaflet-fullscreen` via command line in your project. You must also require this in your project like so: `var leaflet-draw = require('leaflet-fullscreen');`

### Usage

To provide a button for toggling fullscreen on and off:

``` js
// Create a new map with a fullscreen button:
var map = new L.Map('map', {
    fullscreenControl: true,
    // OR
    fullscreenControl: {
        pseudoFullscreen: false // if true, fullscreen to page width and height
    }
});

// or, add to an existing map:
map.addControl(new L.Control.Fullscreen());
```

The plugin also adds several methods to `L.Map` which are always available, even if you choose not to use the fullscreen button:

``` js
map.isFullscreen() // Is the map fullscreen?
map.toggleFullscreen() // Either go fullscreen, or cancel the existing fullscreen.

// `fullscreenchange` Event that's fired when entering or exiting fullscreen.
map.on('fullscreenchange', function () {
    if (map.isFullscreen()) {
        console.log('entered fullscreen');
    } else {
        console.log('exited fullscreen');
    }
});
```
